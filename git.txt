----

==== Branching ====
Creating a nested branch; feature branches off of develop
<code>
git checkout -b myfeature develop
</code>

=== Merging Branches ===
myfeature has been finished! Time to merge back into develop.
<code>
git checkout develop
git merge --no-ff myfeature
git branch -d myfeature
git push origin develop
</code>
  * Switch back to develop branch to "pull in" the feature
  * "--no-ff" to create a new commit object when merging
  * Remove the old branch
  * Push it!

==== Reverting to previous commit ====
Use the first/third lines if there is uncommited work that you want to save, and reinsert after the reset.
<code>
git stash
git reset --hard 0x00SomeHashHere00
git stash pop
</code>

==== Viewing changes of current commit ====
<code>
git diff --cached
</code>
